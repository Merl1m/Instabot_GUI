# Instabot

## About
Instabot is tool orginally scripted to run on commandline interface to extract or scrape the user data from an instagram profile. This script is GUI version of the tool.

## Usage
Install the required python packages by typing the line below in your command prompt.
```$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

Run the script.

## Limitation
The orginal commandline tool is able to download all the posts of the _target user_ however the GUI version doesn't have that feature yet. Sometime in the future I will update the script to be able to do that.
